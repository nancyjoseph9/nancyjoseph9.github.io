In today’s fast-paced world, personal health and fitness are more important than ever, but finding the time, resources, and motivation can be challenging.
During our initial research, we discovered that 70% of people interested in fitness set specific goals but struggle to remain consistent and informed about 
how to achieve them. Additionally, according to a survey by the National Health Survey (NHS), 63% of gym-goers feel uncertain about certain exercises or 
equipment, often leading to demotivation or improper use of gym resources. Our inspiration stemmed from this significant need for a personalized fitness 
assistant that provides visual, interactive, and engaging support for users of all fitness levels.

We wanted to create a solution that goes beyond the traditional workout app, offering a chatbot that can communicate and interact with users through both
text and images. Whether it’s helping users visualize their fitness goals by comparing them to certain body types or providing detailed guidance on using
gym equipment, our chatbot aims to provide a holistic fitness support system.
